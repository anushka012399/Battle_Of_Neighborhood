# Battle Of Neighborhood
This was made by me in 2020 for IBM Final Capstone Project.
Built a Recommender System for expats looking for a family friendly neighborhoods in Downtown Toronto.<br><br>

***Business Problem***<br>
Since Toronto is full of expats, it is implied that many families shift to Toronto every year and seek for a familyfriendly neighbourhood to live in.
Family-friendly neighbourhoods are characterized by:<br>
1. good entertainment venues nearby (theatres, spa, malls, bookstores etc.)<br>
2. close to daily amenities(grocery store, gym, parlour, bank etc.)<br>
3. having a good transport network (bus station, metro, airport etc.)<br>
4. amenities for children (school, park, foodcourts, university etc.)<br>
5. far from nightlife places (bars, pubs etc.)<br>
There is an agent in the downtown borough of Toronto that helps expats find family-friendly neighbourhoodsusing this recommender system. 
This system finds neighbourhoods that have the maximum number of family friendly venues.Features(or categories) that an expat requiers in their 
neighbourhood can be filtered out and customized as per the needs.<br><br>

***Data Acquisition and Cleaning***<br>
For this project, we will be needing three datasets:<br>
1. Dataset that contains a list of all neighbourhoods, their boroughs and postal code of Canada.<br>
2. Geospatial data that contains geo-locational information (latitudes and longitudes) about different
boruoghs and their neighbouhoods.<br>
3. Data obtained using 'Foursquare' to get details about different venues present in the neighbouhood
of the specific borough.(Downtown-in this project)<br><br>

For detailed idea about the project please check the attached pdf "Report of Capstone Project" and pptx "Final Capstone Presentation" in the repository.
